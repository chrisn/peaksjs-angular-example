# Peaks.js Angular Example

This is a simple example of how to use [Peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js)
in an Angular application.

Note that this is just a demo and not a feature-complete reusable Angular component for Peaks.js.

# Getting started

Ensure you have Node.js 14.3.0 or later installed, then:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chrisn/peaksjs-angular-example.git
cd peaksjs-angular-example
npm install
npm start
```

This should open your web browser to view the demo at
http://localhost:4200.
